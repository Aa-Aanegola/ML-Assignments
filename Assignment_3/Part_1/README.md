# PoMDP Belief States
This part of the assignment involved calculating the belief state given an action sequence and a state set up. Details on the setup and more can be found in ```Assignment 3 - Part 1.pdf```. The assignment was intended to be done manually, but we utilised a python program in order to validate our answer.
