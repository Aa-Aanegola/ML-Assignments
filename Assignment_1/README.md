# Bias-Variance Tradeoff
The goal of this assignment was to train several polynomial regression models on a dataset and observe the resulting bias-variance curve. In theory we expected
the bias to decrease as the polynomial order increased and for the variance to increase with the polynomial order. For a detailed overview of the assignment, refer ```report.pdf```.
