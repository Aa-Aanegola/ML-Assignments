# Genetic Algorithms
The goal of this project was to use genetic algorithms to fit a linear regression model without knowledge of the training data. We were given access to an API which allowed us to request the errors (train+val) from a server. The number of requests that we could make per day was restricted and hence we had to come up with a "history" mechanism to store models that we thought would perform well over time. The models that we created were tested on an unseen test set taken from the same dataset as the training data and were ranked on a leaderboard. To understand genetic algorithms, we also tested out a basic version for string matching (can be found in ```Extra```). For a detailed report on our methods, heuristics and more, refer ```report.pdf```. The ```dumps``` directory and ```.txt``` files contain history of a few generations or descriptions of generation history. The code we used can be found in both ```val_overfit.py```(the original model overfit on the training set and so we considered counteracting this by overfitting on the validation set) and ```main.py``` (both training and validation errors are taken into account when trying to obtain optimal weights).
