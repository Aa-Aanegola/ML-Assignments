# Value Iteration
In this part of the assignment we had to use value iteration to create the value function for an MDP. The ultimate goal of this process was to be able to give an agent an optimal policy that it should follow if placed in the environment. The ```outputs``` folder contains the results for each task (details can be found in ```Assignment 2 Part 2 and Part 3.pdf``` in the ```Assignment-2``` directory) in a human readable format (specifies state, action taken at that state, reward and new state taking the environments stochastic nature into account). ```value_iteration.py``` contains our implementation of the value iteration algorithm for this particular MDP. For more information, refer ```report.md``` in the parent ```Assignment-2``` directory.
