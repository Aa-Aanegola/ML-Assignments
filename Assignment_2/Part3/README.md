# Linear Programming
For this part of the assignment, we solved the same MDP using linear programming. In order to use LP to solve the MDP we had to formulate the state-action-reward constraints as linear constraints and then use the ```cvxpy``` solver to solve our system of equations. Details on the creation of the different matrices can be found in ```report.md``` in the ```Assignment-2``` directory. The code written in python to create and solve the linear programming problem can be found in ```linear_programming.py``` and the matrices, state setup and policy obtained can be found in ```part3_output.json```.
