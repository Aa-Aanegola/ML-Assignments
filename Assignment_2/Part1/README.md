# Manual Value-Iteration
For this assignment we had to manually apply the value iteration algorithm on a simple MDP. The report for this process can be found in ```201910101009.pdf``` and the ```MDL Asssignment 2 Part 1.pdf``` file contains the description of the MDP and some other submission details. However the report is comprehensive and the setup can easily be understood from it.
