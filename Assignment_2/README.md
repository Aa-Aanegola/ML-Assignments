# Markov Decision Processes
The goal of this assignment was to experiment with MDP's and the basics of reinforcement learning (value iteration). We used value iteration by hand to come up with the values for the states in a simple MDP by hand (part 1) and then applied the same concepts to a more complicated MDP using python (part 2). We also used linear programming to solve the same MDP (part 3).
